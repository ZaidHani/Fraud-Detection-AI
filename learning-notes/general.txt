the wait-for-it.sh file is copied from github, it's used wait for the port to be availabe...

you see the service "mc" in the docker compose file? we are using the wait-for-it code to wait for the port to be availabe and execute the rest of the code...

if you wanted to change the script location, you'll probably need to readjust the volume's path of the wait-for-it.sh

this is the commmand used to run the docker compose file:
docker compose --profile flower up -d --build
--profile		Specify a profile to enable (flower profile)
--build		Build images before starting containers
-d, --detach		Detached mode: Run containers in the background


you need to enable multiple dbs for the postgres.
you'll have to add another volume for the postgres service
and you need to run certain commands in a file to make postgres accept mlflow, in my case I've created a file called init-multiple-dbs.sh
you'll also have to change it's permissions to make it executable, by using this command:
chmod +x init-multiple-dbs.sh
however, this won't work in windows.
