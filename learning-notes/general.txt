the wait-for-it.sh file is copied from github, it's used wait for the port to be availabe...

you see the service "mc" in the docker compose file? we are using the wait-for-it code to wait for the port to be availabe and execute the rest of the code...

if you wanted to change the script location, you'll probably need to readjust the volume's path of the wait-for-it.sh

this is the commmand used to run the docker compose file:
docker compose --profile flower up -d --build
--profile		Specify a profile to enable (flower profile)
--build		Build images before starting containers
-d, --detach		Detached mode: Run containers in the background
