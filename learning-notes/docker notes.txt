Image = A pre-packaged, ready-to-run snapshot of an application

    Think of it like a frozen pizza - ready to use immediately
    Contains the OS, code, dependencies, everything needed to run
    Stored in registries (like Docker Hub)

Build = The process of creating an image from instructions (Dockerfile)

    Think of it like making pizza from scratch using a recipe
    Takes source code + Dockerfile and produces an image
    Takes time but gives you full control


mind blowing thing:
this docker compose file in the src dir, is not just for airflow.
airflow is just another service in the YAML file...

this yaml file is an end-to-end network to run airflow... 

you can use the image to do other stuff not just airflow.


## Airflow Is Actually MULTIPLE Services

Airflow typically runs as **3-4 separate containers**:

**1. airflow-webserver** - The UI (port 8080)
**2. airflow-scheduler** - Decides when to run tasks
**3. airflow-worker** - Actually executes tasks
**4. airflow-triggerer** (optional) - Handles deferrable operators

They all use the **same image** (`airflow-training:latest`), but run different commands.
